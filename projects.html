            This project is a personal passion project for me stemming from seeing my peers, 
            colleagues, and other creatives struggle keeping their ideas organized and stress free. 
            Sadly this has lead to many of them dropping what could have been wonderful worlds and 
            settings for their next book, film, or even DnD Campaigns. This is what my application is for, 
            a helpful means for a creative to put their stories, references, and characters all in one place 
            where they can view them and organize them in a stress-free manner as they work.
